# Project Victory Web System

1. Blocking of specific troll accounts, e.g. being able to block @joelgethinlewis from being able to interact at all
2. Blocking of tweets with specific keywords such as swear words, or non brand words such as Reebok. This list will be editable on the web interface.
3. Manual review of tweets that have passed 1) + 2) by the 5/10 person Nike team, who could be anywhere in the world
4. Final manual review of tweets that have passed 1) 2) and 3) by an onsite Nike legal/PR/marketing representative who will be taking legal responsibility for the text content - H&L and our team will not be legally responsible for any of the content that emerges from this project.
